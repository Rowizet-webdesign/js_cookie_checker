js_cookie_checker
=================

JS_cookie_checker is a simple pure javascript written in a few lines that you can use to periodically check the existence of a system cookie whose existence is imperative to the well functionning of your website or application.

A use example of js_cookie_checker.js is with the system cookie "c_user" from Facebook, that contains the ID of the current user.
While browsing the social network, if you delete the cookie, your naviguation capability is almost instanteneously halted by an overlayed fancy windows that pops up on your screen.

Have fun with its tuning :)
